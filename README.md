## 🏗️ Tech Stack  

| **Technology**   | **Description**  |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Frontend**     | `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` – These core web technologies are used to build a responsive and interactive frontend. HTML structures the content, CSS handles styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features such as real-time cart updates.  |
| **Backend**      | `PHP` with `MySQL` – PHP powers the backend logic, including handling requests, processing forms, and connecting to the database to store user and product data. MySQL is used to store and retrieve information such as user accounts, product details, and order history. |
| **Database**     | `MySQL` – MySQL is used for relational data management. It handles storing and retrieving user data, orders, products, and more. The use of MySQL ensures fast querying and reliable data storage for high-traffic e-commerce sites. |
| **Styling**      | `Bootstrap` / `Tailwind CSS` – These frameworks provide pre-designed, responsive components that enable rapid development. Bootstrap offers a variety of pre-built elements, while Tailwind CSS allows for a more customizable approach using utility classes to style each element. |
| **Authentication** | `JWT` / Session-based – JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and session-based authentication methods provide secure ways to verify and manage users' identities across the platform. JWT offers a stateless approach, while session-based authentication maintains user sessions on the server. |
